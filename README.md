# FURP-VR-GROUP-PROJECT

This is the project for FURP VR GROUP to share your contributions with others.

Everyone did a very impressive work. Hope in next 2 weeks, we can combine our contributions together and start to build a complete Unity program.

This program should have:

1. a complete scenario of fireground but not complex. For example: one floor, serveral rooms, basic furnitures as obstacles
2. trapped person behavior. The trapped person should have reasonable behaviors. 
3. fundamental interactions with objects. e.g. grab objects, open/close door, rescue person
4. fire and smoke effect. The fire should be able to spread, the smoke spreading should be related to the fire.
5. an explosion effect that will cause a further more serious fire spreading as well as smoke.

After that, we will add movements and views interaction of the user and finally investigate how to create a VR application in the VR device.

Thanks!
